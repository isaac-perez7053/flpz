# The flpz Program #
####################


* What does it do? *
********************

The flpz program will take in a crystal and a phonon representation and calculate the flexoelectric 
and piezoelectric tensors of the crystal once the phonon with the specified representation is frozen
in place. You can calculate multiple datapoints for multiple amplitudes of the frozen in phonon. 

* Inputs *
**********

1.) general_structure.abi: An abinit file that defines the crystal, k-point lattice, and any SCF procedure variables such as 
tolerances and ecut. Two input files are included as examples. The default behavior of the script will calculate all unstables
unless otherwise specifies, as shown in inputfile2.in. 

2.) sInput.txt: A file that serves as the input to the smodes program on Isotropy. Written as:
acell parameters
space group number
primitive vectors and angles
wyckoff positions of atoms listed in "atom name" and "position"
number of phonon points listed (should be 1) 
phonon points (e.g. GM or M)

3. irrep: The irrepresentation at a particular point in the brillouin zone 
(e.g. M3+ or GM4-)

* Outputs *
***********

1.) A matlab file name Datasets.m that can be plugged in using the attached matlab code to plot 
the piezoelectric and flexoeelctric tensor components. The x-point (amplitude) and total energy
of each perturbed unit cell are included as vectors as well. 

2.) All input files that were used in the program (excluding bash scripts)


* Setup * 
*********

Current use: Currently, this program is successfully running on an linux super computer at HMC. There, SLURM and ABINIT are downloaded
onto the program itself.

When beginning the program, a few things must be completed first:
1.) Ensure all files have executable permissions, particularly the python scripts and isobyu folder that contains the ISOTROPY programs. I 
will likely automate this to save time in the future. 
2.) Any call to the flpz program should be done with flpz_code and flpz_input directories in the current working directory. Furthermore, 
pseudopotentials for all atoms should exist in the current directory and the current parent directory. I will also fix this in the future. 
3.) Before beginning, you must write a batch script preamble text file as shown above that works on your current computer with SLURM. Run the script, 
bash compileFLPZ.sh flpz_input "batchScriptPreamble.txt" 
4.) (optional) I created a alias to the flpz program "alias flpz='bash flpz' for cleaner calls. Call the flpz program with 
flpz (ENERGY/PERT/CPL) <input_file> <smodes_input> <irrep>
5.) winner 

* Final Note *
**************

You should run flpzEnergy.sh to check whether you have hit an instability and see which phonons you want calculated before running the full
calculation. The space group of the perturbed and unperturbed cell will be printed in the terminal or log. 

In the future, I will also add the ability to calculate and plot any possible couplings between eigendisplacements of a crystal.

* TODO * 
********

In the current version, it is required that you do the phonon calculations separately before doing their coupling but in the future I would like to 
implement a feature that doesn't require this and allows users to run the coupling calculation without doing 2 separate calculations.
